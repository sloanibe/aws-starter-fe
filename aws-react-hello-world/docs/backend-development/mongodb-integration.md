# MongoDB Integration in Spring Boot

This document explains how MongoDB integration works in our Spring Boot application, focusing on data models, repositories, and the automatic schema propagation process.

## MongoDB Data Models

In our application, MongoDB data models are defined as Java classes annotated with `@Document`. These classes represent the structure of documents stored in MongoDB collections.

### Example: TaskEntity

```java
@Document(collection = "tasks")
public class TaskEntity {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private String status; // "TODO", "IN_PROGRESS", "DONE"
    private String priority; // "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW"
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;
    private String category;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    private boolean completed;
    
    // Constructors, getters, and setters...
}
```

## Automatic Schema Propagation

Unlike relational databases, MongoDB is schema-less, which provides significant flexibility in data modeling. Here's how the model propagation works:

### 1. Schema-less Nature of MongoDB

MongoDB doesn't require predefined schemas. Collections (similar to tables in relational databases) are created automatically when documents are first inserted. This means:

- No need to run schema migration scripts
- No need to define table structures before using them
- Collections adapt to the document structure you provide

### 2. Spring Data MongoDB Mapping

When a class is annotated with `@Document(collection = "collectionName")`, Spring Data MongoDB maps this Java class to a MongoDB collection:

- The class name doesn't have to match the collection name
- The collection name is specified in the annotation
- Fields in the class become fields in the MongoDB document

### 3. Automatic Collection Creation

The first time you save an entity object through a repository:

- Spring checks if the specified collection exists in MongoDB
- If it doesn't exist, MongoDB automatically creates it
- The document is then inserted into the collection

### 4. No Migration Required

One of the key advantages of MongoDB's schema-less nature:

- Adding new fields to your entity class doesn't require database changes
- Existing documents simply won't have the new field until they're updated
- Different documents in the same collection can have different fields

## MongoDB Repositories

Spring Data MongoDB provides a powerful repository abstraction that eliminates boilerplate code:

```java
public interface TaskRepository extends MongoRepository<TaskEntity, String> {
    List<TaskEntity> findByStatus(String status);
    List<TaskEntity> findByCategory(String category);
    // More query methods...
}
```

These repositories automatically implement CRUD operations and custom query methods based on method names.

## Deployment Process

When deploying updates to MongoDB models:

1. Add/modify the entity classes as needed
2. Update repository interfaces if necessary
3. Build and deploy the application
4. The changes take effect immediately - no separate database migration step is required

## Best Practices

Despite MongoDB's schema-less nature, it's important to maintain consistency:

1. **Document Structure**: Keep document structures consistent for better query performance
2. **Validation**: Consider using Bean Validation or custom validation in service layers
3. **Indexes**: Create appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
4. **References**: Use DBRef or manual references for related documents when appropriate

## Conclusion

MongoDB's schema-less nature, combined with Spring Data MongoDB's mapping capabilities, provides a flexible and efficient way to manage data models. The automatic propagation of model changes eliminates the need for complex migration scripts, making development and deployment faster and more agile.
