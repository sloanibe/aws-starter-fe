# Documentation Workflow

This guide outlines the recommended workflow for creating, updating, and maintaining documentation in our system.

## Complete Documentation Lifecycle

### 1. Planning

Before creating documentation:

- Identify the target audience
- Determine the appropriate category
- Choose the most suitable template
- Outline the key points to cover

### 2. Creation

Create the documentation using our CLI tool:

```bash
npm run docs:create -- --category=<category> --name="<Document Title>" --template=<template> --tags="<tags>"
```

This will:
- Create a new markdown file with appropriate frontmatter
- Place it in the correct category directory
- Update the navigation structure
- Copy the file to the public directory

### 3. Writing

Edit the generated file to add your content:

- Follow the structure provided by the template
- Add code examples where appropriate
- Include screenshots or diagrams if needed
- Link to related documentation

### 4. Review

Before publishing:

- Preview the documentation locally with `npm run dev`
- Check for technical accuracy
- Ensure the documentation follows our style guidelines
- Verify that links work correctly

### 5. Publishing

Deploy the documentation to production:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the application with the updated documentation
- Deploy to the S3 bucket
- Invalidate the CloudFront cache

### 6. Maintenance

Regularly review and update documentation:

- Update when features change
- Add clarification based on user feedback
- Fix any reported issues
- Remove outdated information

## Best Practices

### Organization

- Use meaningful category names
- Keep related documentation together
- Use the order field to create a logical reading sequence
- Add appropriate tags for searchability

### Content

- Start with a clear overview
- Use headings to organize content
- Include examples and code snippets
- Link to related documentation
- Add troubleshooting sections for complex topics

### Formatting

- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use tables for structured data
- Add emphasis for important points

## Collaborative Documentation

When working as a team:

1. **Coordinate categories**: Agree on category structure before creating documentation
2. **Use order numbers strategically**: Leave gaps in order numbers to allow for future insertions
3. **Cross-reference**: Link between related documents
4. **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same style and structure across all documentation

## Testing Documentation

To ensure your documentation is effective:

1. **Follow your own instructions**: Try following the steps you've documented
2. **Get feedback**: Ask others to review and test your documentation
3. **Monitor usage**: Track which documentation pages are most visited
4. **Address questions**: Update documentation based on common questions

## Documentation Driven Development

Consider writing documentation before or alongside development:

1. Document the planned functionality
2. Use documentation to clarify requirements
3. Update documentation as implementation details are finalized
4. Release documentation with the feature

This approach helps ensure features are well-documented and user-focused.
