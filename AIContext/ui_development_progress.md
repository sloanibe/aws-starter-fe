# Project Management UI Development Progress

## Overview
We've created a comprehensive set of UI mockups for the project management system using HTML, CSS, and Material Design principles. These mockups follow a flexbox-centric layout and demonstrate the core functionality of the application without interfering with the main project codebase.

## Current Status

### Completed Mockups
1. **Dashboard View** (`index.html`, `styles.css`)
   - Top navigation bar with search and user profile
   - Side navigation with project list and color coding
   - Project cards with status indicators (Active, Completed, Archived)
   - Progress tracking for tasks within projects
   - Recent activity feed
   - Statistics dashboard with key metrics

2. **Project Detail View** (`project-detail.html`, `project-detail.css`)
   - Project header with color coding and description
   - Project navigation tabs
   - Kanban-style task board with columns for different statuses
   - Task cards with priority indicators, assignees, and metadata
   - Board filtering options

3. **Task Detail View** (`task-detail.html`, `task-detail.css`)
   - Comprehensive task information display
   - Task description and metadata sidebar
   - Chronological history of task updates and comments
   - Support for @mentions in comments
   - Attachment handling
   - Task action buttons

### Implementation Details
- All mockups use a consistent design language based on Material Design
- Responsive layouts using flexbox for compatibility across device sizes
- Interactive navigation between all views
- Color-coded visual elements for project identification
- Support for all required features from the project specification:
  - Project-centric organization
  - User assignments with reporter and assignee tracking
  - Task status updates and comments
  - Chronological history of task activity

### Next Steps
1. **React Component Implementation**
   - Convert HTML/CSS mockups to React components
   - Implement state management for the application
   - Create reusable components for common UI elements (cards, navigation, etc.)

2. **API Integration**
   - Connect UI components to the backend API endpoints
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add real-time updates for task changes

3. **Additional Features**
   - Implement drag-and-drop for the Kanban board
   - Add filtering and search functionality
   - Create form components for adding/editing projects and tasks

## Technical Decisions
- Used pure HTML/CSS for mockups to focus on design before implementation
- Followed Material Design principles for a modern, clean interface
- Implemented a responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Created a modular CSS structure that can be easily adapted to component-based architecture

## File Structure

All mockups have been committed to the git repository and are ready for the next phase of development.
